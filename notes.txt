css grid system
---------------
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Display Property
An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.

syntax
------
.grid-container {
  display: inline-grid;
}

Grid Gaps
----------
The spaces between each column/row are called gaps.

You can adjust the gap size by using one of the following properties:

* column-gap
* row-gap
* gap

Example
-The column-gap property sets the gap between the columns:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  column-gap: 50px;
}

-The row-gap property sets the gap between the rows:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  row-gap: 50px;
}

-The gap property is a shorthand property for the row-gap and the column-gap properties:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  gap: 50px 100px;
}
